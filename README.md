# search engine

Developing a search engine for the web

## Todo

- [ ] Scrapper
- [ ] Server
  - [ ] FTS using Meilisearch
- [ ] Client

Plan is to use Python + BeautifulSoup for scrapper, crawl the web for links, images, videos and titles. Store the data in a database and use Meilisearch for full text search. The client will be a simple web page with a search bar and the results will be displayed in a list.
